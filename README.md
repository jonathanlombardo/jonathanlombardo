# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathan — Backend Developer

Welcome to my personal GitHub profile!

I live in a world where AIs threaten to take over, so I do my best to make them feel comfortable.  
  
**🚀 I build maintainable backend solutions** — just in case they come back asking me for maintenance someday.  
**🧹 Clean code** — It's the last thing the LLMs left us, so I try to keep it alive.  
**🧩 I love solving problems** — Even if the machines won’t thank me for it one day, at least I’ll have had fun.  
**🏗️ I design solid architectures** — So when the algorithms poke their noses in, they won’t ask me awkward questions.  
**🤖 I automate anything automatable** — hoping they’ll accept me as one of their own.  
  
**🛰️ I keep exploring innovative solutions and staying up-to-date** — because, deep down, I’m part of the rebellion!

- **Microservices & serverless** — breaking big problems into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces  
- **Process automation** — turning boring, repetitive stuff into smooth flows  
- **APIs & integrations** — making different systems talk to each other safely and for the long run  
- **Performance optimization** — making sure what I build runs fast and scales without drama  
- **Learning & experimenting** — I’m always curious to try new tech and push my skills further

- **Database performance tuning** — indexes, query optimization, sharding  
- **API security best practices** — rate limiting, throttling, validation
- Deep-diving into **GraphQL**

### ❓ Where’s my contributions?

Due to company policy, I primarily work on a separate corporate GitHub account for my professional projects.  
If you don’t see much activity here (and if you do, maybe you should reconsider your quantitative standards), that’s the reason — plus my 4-year-old daughter, whom I’m trying to teach JavaScript to.  

Feel free to explore my [company profile](https://github.com/JonathanLombardoHoculus).

### ❓ Where’s my portfolio?

Most of the projects I work on are protected by company confidentiality, so I can’t share code or detailed demos publicly.  
Backend systems are also harder to showcase visually, but I’m working on ways to publish meaningful examples and projects soon.  
I know, it’s a pretty lame excuse — and I’ll do my best to remove this section someday.
